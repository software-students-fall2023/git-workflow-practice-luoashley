I think this article is very interesting and useful to me. Code reviewing is highly important in software engineering, and this article provides a valuable framework for improving the effectiveness of code reviews. Two key points stood out: the use of automation for mundane checks, allowing human reviewers to focus on more complex issues; and the emphasis on respectful, constructive communication during the review process. These insights collectively suggest that a well-designed code review is not just about finding errors, but also about fostering a collaborative, learning-oriented environment among developers.
